    <p>AirPods Pro have been reengineered for even richer audio experiences. Next-level Active Noise Cancellation and Adaptive Transparency reduce more external noise. Spatial Audio takes immersion to a remarkably personal level. Touch control now lets you adjust volume with a swipe. And a leap in power delivers 6 hours of battery life from a single charge.</p>
