    <p>The M2 chip begins the next generation of Apple silicon, with even more of the speed and power efficiency introduced by M1. So you can rip through workflows with a more powerful 8-core CPU. Create stunning graphics with a lightning‑fast 10‑core GPU. Work with more streams of 4K and 8K ProRes video with the high-performance media engine. And do it all at once with up to 24GB of faster unified memory.</p>
