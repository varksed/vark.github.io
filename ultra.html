    <p>To build the ultimate sports watch, we crafted every element with painstaking attention to detail for unparalleled performance. Titanium strikes the perfect balance between weight, ruggedness and corrosion resistance. The new case design rises up to surround the flat sapphire crystal and protect it from edge impacts. The Digital Crown is larger and the side button is raised from the case, making them easier to use while you’re wearing gloves.</p>
    <p>Whether it’s your first run in a while, a 10K or an ultramarathon, it takes a special kind of person to seek out challenges that test you physically. Apple Watch Ultra is the training partner to help you push your limits.
